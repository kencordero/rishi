A flashcard-like Android app for toddlers.

My goal with this app was to have an application that my children could use to learn a few basic words in the three languages that their mother and I are trying to teach them natively.

The pictures are broken up into six categories: 
* Foods
* Animals
* Colors
* Letters
* Shapes
* Numbers

At this time, the app shows the word for the picture in three different languages:
* English
* Marathi
* Spanish
